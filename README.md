# Decentralized web application for hosting files
As the word is on a fast-paced track and moving more and more toward 
digitalization, there is still a lot of businesses which have not yet entered the digital 
market. One of the popular ways of making a presence in digital world is through 
web-apps and websites. But, today, almost all web-hosting services are based on 
client-server architecture. This has several disadvantages and does not serve 
everyone is use cases. The major disadvantage is that all the services are 
centralized, and databases are mutable, which is a vulnerability. So, the aim is to 
create a web-hosting service based on blockchain wherein we ensure immutability 
of data and decentralization. Our project also aims to reduce redundancy while 
maintaining high volumes of data. The initial cost of setting up webhosting through 
blockchain is also vastly reduced along with saving big on bandwidth, for example, 
60% bandwidth when transmitting videos through server. The web-hosting 
services will be used by archivists, hospitals and similar organizations, and even 
normal users who require immutable decentralized network.
